In 2019, however, cannabis for recreational (non-medical) purposes, will be legal for use by adults without the need for any prescription. The introduction of this new industry sector is currently causing a “green rush” which has everyone in the cannabis industry racing to get in on the action. There is enormous genetic variety within the cannabis species, yielding a wide range of intended uses and effects. There are a number of different products that will be coming online over the next few years. These include, concentrates and edibles. Across the country, licensed producers are eagerly developing their innovative cannabis products. With the enactment of the new Cannabis Act, new license classes are being introduced. A general License to Produce cannabis will be replaced by Cultivation Licenses and Processing Licenses. There will be different personnel/staffing requirements depending on the license type. Micro production licensing is also a new and exciting introduction within the Act. The micro production scene will foster a craft cannabis industry and promote the discovery, creation and cultivation of new strains. Innovate Phytoceuticals provides guidance and direction to the cannabis industry, from acquiring your licensing to developing your cannabis products. Let us help you navigate the new Act and Regulations.",

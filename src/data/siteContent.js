                "Canada’s cannabis industry is emerging from prohibition. Medical cannabis has been legal for use with a valid prescription since 2001. In 2019, however, cannabis for recreational (non-medical) purposes, will be legal for use by adults without the need for any prescription. The introduction of this new industry sector is currently causing a “green rush” which has everyone in the cannabis industry racing to get in on the action. There is enormous genetic variety within the cannabis species, yielding a wide range of intended uses and effects. There are a number of different products that will be coming online over the next few years. These include, concentrates and edibles. Across the country, licensed producers are eagerly developing their innovative cannabis products.",

                "With the enactment of the new Cannabis Act, new license classes are being introduced. A general License to Produce cannabis will be replaced by Cultivation Licenses and Processing Licenses. There will be different personnel/staffing requirements depending on the license type. Micro production licensing is also a new and exciting introduction within the Act. The micro production scene will foster a craft cannabis industry and promote the discovery, creation and cultivation of new strains. Innovate Phytoceuticals provides guidance and direction to the cannabis industry, from acquiring your licensing to developing your cannabis products. Let us help you navigate the new Act and Regulations.",

He was involved with the surveillance study of molecular epidemiology of infectious disease along with public health. He has training on bioinformatics and sequencing from Oxford University and developed pathogen detection system for culture negative meningitis disease. He also contributed in generating serotype distribution data of pneumococcal disease which helped in pneumococcal vaccine formulation for the developing countries. The outcome of his contribution in clinical microbiology directly influenced treatment policy for South Asian countries. He coordinated clinical projects and laboratory activities in the network of four hospitals in Bangladesh funded by WHO. He contributed in development of laboratory setup, data management system, study design and protocol for “Aetiology of Neonatal Infection in South Asia” funded by BMGF. After moving to Canada in 2015, he involved himself with water research at UBCO. He also has the experience of working in the Cannabis industry. As a microbiologist at THC biomed he was responsible for the quality control of propagation, production, distribution, packaging and laboratory analysis of medical marijuana. He is the author of 17 peer reviewed scientific publications to date.",

His research projects focused on protocol development for tissue culture propagation, gene identification and functional studies (in vitro and in vivo), plant and microbial transformation, essential oil extraction and terpene detection, and sequencing. Dr. Adal holds B.Sc. in Horticulture at Jimma University (Ethiopia), M.Sc. in Plant Biotechnology at Leibniz University of Hannover (Germany) and Ph.D. in Biology at the University of British Columbia (UBC). In his Ph.D. thesis “Development of molecular markers and cloning of genes involved in the biosynthesis of monoterpenes in Lavandula”, he covers several molecular and bioinformatics approaches, including gene identification, cloning and expression in microbial and plant hosts, marker development and genotyping, detection of terpenes, and transcriptome sequencing. After his Ph.D., he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at UBC focusing on coordinating a research cluster of “Agricultural Technologies and Bioproducts”, and examining molecular mechanisms that control floral development and their impacts on specialized metabolites in cannabis and lavender. Dr. Adal is also experienced in mentoring technicians and junior researchers, as well as teaching laboratory and lecture courses at UBC. Dr. Adal produced over 20 peer-reviewed publications and presented these outcomes to scientific and industrial communities at local and international conferences",
